<p><em>Isomorphic</em> web applications are becoming popular and accepted methodology by many in the Game.
in dictionary terms, it means something of the corresponding or similar form or relations.</p>

<p>Hmm&hellip; wth! I know&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="what-is-isomorphic-though">what is isomorphic, though?</h3>

<p>isomorphic webapps are when <em>server and client share some common data with each other</em> and thus correspond/relate to each other inorder to deliver quicker, providing better user experience, improved discovery via search engines, and reduced ops since parts of code is shared b/w both parties.</p>

<h3 id="ok-great-but-should-i-really-care-about-this">ok great! but should i really care about this?</h3>

<p>IT companies like Bloomberg, Netflix, Airbnb, Google, Facebook have accepted isomorphic web application with good reason &ndash; <strong>better financial outcomes</strong>.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s been <a href="https://www.globaldots.com/how-website-speed-affects-conversion-rates/">studies</a> around how website&rsquo;s speed affect revenues made by visitors, i.e. <strong>webapp&rsquo;s latency âˆž conversion rates</strong> !</p>

<p>and if my client and server share some data/functionality, i&rsquo;m probably going to see lower latency. Makes sense, right? <a href="https://go.isomorphicgo.org/">isomorphic-go</a> is caring &lsquo;bout your end users as well as your business outcomes.</p>

<p><em>p.s: this is <strong>wip</strong>.</em></p>
