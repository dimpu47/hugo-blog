Btw, there already is a lot of cool resources on websockets in go, this is just for me to yap about 'em again if you [remember](https://dimpu47.github.io/about). I'll be building a basic simple chat application that allows user to have live real time conversion over http.

This is just to brush up goroutines, channels and concurrency in Go.
