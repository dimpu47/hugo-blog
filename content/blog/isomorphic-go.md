> Sharing is caring is a cliche but not when is comes to webapps.

*Isomorphic* web applications are becoming popular and accepted methodology by many in the Game.
in dictionary terms, it means something of the corresponding or similar form or relations. 

Hmm... wth! I know...

### what is isomorphic, though?

isomorphic webapps are when *server and client share some common data with each other* and thus correspond/relate to each other inorder to deliver quicker, providing better user experience, improved discovery via search engines, and reduced ops since parts of code is shared b/w both parties.

### ok great! but should i really care about this?

IT companies like Bloomberg, Netflix, Airbnb, Google, Facebook have accepted isomorphic web application with good reason -- **better financial outcomes**.

There's been [studies](https://www.globaldots.com/how-website-speed-affects-conversion-rates/) around how website's speed affect revenues made by visitors, i.e. **webapp's latency âˆž conversion rates** !

and if my client and server share some data/functionality, i'm probably going to see lower latency. Makes sense, right? [isomorphic-go](https://go.isomorphicgo.org/) is caring 'bout your end users as well as your business outcomes.

_p.s: this is **wip**._
