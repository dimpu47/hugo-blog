### what is isomorphic, though?

isomorphic web applications are becoming popular and crucial for many big companies. Isomorphic in dictionary terms, it means something of the corresponding or similar form. Hmm... no what the hell ? I know !

isomorphic webapps are where server and client share some common data with each other and thus correspond to each other in a way. they provide better ux, improved discovery via search engines, and reduced ops since parts of code is shared.

### why should i care ?

because it companies like Bloomberg, Netflix, Airbnb, Google, Facebook have accepted isomorphic web application with good reason -- better financial outcomes.

There's been studies ( [obviously] (https://www.globaldots.com/how-website-speed-affects-conversion-rates/) ) around how website's speed affect revenues made by visitors, i.e. webapp's latency âˆž better conversion rates !

and if my client and server share some data, i'm probably going to see lower latency. right?
